Equalizes the columns on your theme so they are the same size regardless of page length.
I did not write the js script.  I would give credit to whoever wrote it, but it doesn't contain any author information.  If you wrote this js, then contact me, I will add your credits here.

== Description ==

Its very simple, but its saved me quite a bit of time when developing new themes.  Basically this plugin will equalize the columns in your theme to ensure that they are of equal lengths.

NOTE: Your theme must use the following column names: “rightnav”,”bodycontent”,”leftnav”,”sidebar”,”sidebar1?,”sidebar2?,”content”.

You can modify the equalcolumns.js Line 2 to contain any column definitions you may have for your theme
