This plugin will equalize the columns (content and sidebar) in your theme to ensure that they are of equal lengths.
I've ported this js utility to wordpress. 

== Description ==

Its very simple, but its saved me quite a bit of time when developing new themes.  Basically this plugin will equalize the columns in your theme to ensure that they are of equal lengths.

NOTE: Your theme must use the following column names: "rightnav","bodycontent","leftnav","sidebar","sidebar1?,"sidebar2?,"content".

You can modify the equalcolumns.js Line 2 to contain any column definitions you may have for your theme

All the information (general, changelog, installation, upgrade, usage) you need about this plugin can be found here: [WP-Equal-columns Readme](http://www.kennedymedia.com/wp-equal-columns/ "WP-equal-columns Readme").

NOTE:  I did not write the js script.  I would give credit to whoever wrote it, but it doesn't contain any author information.  If you wrote this js, then contact me, I will add your credits here.
